# What is it

UI5Lab is a community driven repository for UI5 Custom Control Libraries. It's purpose is to make it easy for everyone to share, retrieve and use UI5 Custom Controls. Contributions welcome!

# UI5Lab-app-simple

This repository contains a simple app that consumes custom controls from the UI5Lab example library [geometry](https://github.com/UI5Lab/UI5Lab-library-simple). Have a look at our [documentation](http://ui5lab.io/docs/) for more details.

# Publish

The [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) creates an optimized app ready to be deployed on a web server.
There are three variants to create an optimized build in the ```dist``` folder included in this repository:

1. Build app and libraries (default)

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized preloads for the app and all used libraries

1. Build app and switch to CDN bootstrap (demo)

```bash
npm run buildCDN
```

Creates an optimized app switched to CDN bootstrap for best loading performance.
You can find the [published app](https://ui5lab.github.io/UI5Lab-app-simple/index.html) in the ```gh-pages``` branch.

2. Self-contained build (minimal)

```bash
npm run buildSelfContained
```

Creates a custom UI5 bundle with a minimal set code both from library and app resources
